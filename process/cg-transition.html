<p>This page concerns itself only with generically applicable requirements when transitioning work from a Community Group to a Working Group. Specific Community Groups and Working Groups may have additional specific requirements.</p>

<p>To assess whether a given work is ready to transition to a Working Group, please refer to <a href="https://www.w3.org/Guide/standards-track/">W3C Recommendation Track Readiness Best Practices</a>.</p>

<h2>Figuring out how the Community Group/Working Group will collaborate</h2>
<p>When work transitions from a Community Group to a Working Group, it is often the case that the Community Group will want to be in a position to be involved in the discussions subsequent to the transition, for the said specific work or for some related work.</p>

<p>Several patterns of collaboration have emerged in how a Community Group might relate to a Working Group:</p>
<p>@@@TODO import patterns from <a href="https://github.com/w3c/charter-drafts/issues/262">charter template discussion</a></p>

<p>Independently of which of these patterns (or a different pattern) is adopted, the expectation is that once the Working Group has adopted the work, the IPR commitments on the work will be sought based on the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy">Patent Policy applicable to the Recommendation track</a>.</p>

<h2>Getting approval to transition</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Has the Community Group agreed to the transition in a manner consistent with its practices? Is there clarity on how the Community Group will collaborate with the Working Group in the future (if at all)?</li>
  <li>Does the Working Group that would take over the work exists? If not, a <a href="https://www.w3.org/Guide/process/charter.html">charter needs to be written and approved</a> for the new Working Group to be created.</li>
  <li>If the Working Group exists, is the work being transitioned in the scope of its existing charter? If not, the target Working Group needs to be <a href="https://www.w3.org/Guide/process/charter.html">rechartered to accommodate the new work</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Operationalizing the transition</h2>
<p>IPR considerations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Have all contributions incorporated in the work being transitioned been associated with a <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/about/process/cla/">Community Group Contribution Licensing Agreeement</a>?</li>
  <li>Has there been a call for <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/about/process/final/">Final Specification Agreement</a> been made on the proposed work?</li>
  <li>Are major contributors to the work in the Community Group expecting to join the relevant Working Group?</li>
</ul>

<p>Participation:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Make sure to keep the Community Group participants aware of the progress on the transition roadmap, in particular if it involves chartering or re-chartering a Working Group</li>
  <li>If Community Group participants want to join the Working Group, but are not affiliated with a W3C Member organization, please invite them to contact <a href="mailto:abird@w3.org">Alan Bird</a> to explore <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/membership">W3C Membership</a> - during that exploration, <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/about/faq/#how-do-community-groups-make-it-easier-to-move-to-the-standards-track">Community Group participants may continue participating in the Working Group as Invited Experts</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Assuming the work has been developed in a github repository:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If the repository is hosted in a Github organization not yet used by W3C to host Recommendation work:<ul>
      <li>Will the repository itself be transitioned to the W3C GitHub organization?</li>
      <li>If not, is the repository owner willing to grant admin rights to @w3cbot (which is used to help with managing operational matters on W3C work, incl for horizontal review and IPR management)?</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Is the repository already being monitored by <a href="https://labs.w3.org/repo-manager/">W3C's IPR Repo Manager</a>?<ul>
      <li>If not, evaluate even more carefully the IPR considerations set above.</li>
      <li>If yes, once the transition is enacted (e.g. when the new Working Group is launched), the IPR manager will need to be updated to reflect the new IPR status of the work (contact <a href="mailto:dom@w3.org">dom@w3.org</a> or <a href="mailto:plh@w3.org">plh@w3.org</a>); if the repo is being moved or renamed at the time of transition, please coordinate specifically with <a href="mailto:dom@w3.org">dom@w3.org</a> as this operation requires special handling at the moment.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Other repository administrativia:<ul>
      <li>If not already set up, ask <a href="mailto:plh@w3.org">plh@w3.org</a> to configure the repository with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Guide/documentreview/#working_with_horizontal_review_labels">labels used for tracking horizontal reviews</a></li>
      <li>If not already set up, make sure members of the <code>horizontal-admin</code> team have triage access to the repo; if unsure, ask <a href="mailto:plh@w3.org">plh@w3.org</a></li>
      <li>Update or add LICENSE.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md to reflect the new contribution framework</li>
      <li>If not already set up that way, consider <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/spec-prod/2021JanMar/0017.html">moving away from using <code>master</code> as the name of the default branch</a></li>
  </ul></li>

</ul>
