            <p>This document is likely unapplicable given the adoption of Process 2023. ACTION plh: salvage it for the
              purpose of the Team finding consensus or simply redirect to the <a href="../council/council.html">Council guide</a> (plh - 2023/09/09)</p>
          </div>
          <p>This public document was enacted on 6 December 2017,
          following approval by W3C Management and the W3C Advisory
          Board, and came into effect on 13 December 2017.</p>
          <h2 id="processing">Processing of Formal Objections</h2>
          <p>There are various places in the W3C Process where
            individuals might raise a Formal Objection to the Director of
            the W3C.  Today, there are limited guidelines about how these
            issues should be addressed. This document
            outlines <a href="#bp">Best Practices</a> for complex cases that
            the Director delegates to another individual.</p>

          <p>Part of the reason that there are no written guidelines is because the
            W3C Director is expected to employ a strong sense of fairness to resolve
            issues in a way that is in the best interests of the Web. This requires
            expert human judgment, making it difficult to require that the Director
            process Formal Objections in any particular manner.  At times,
            however, the Director might find it advantageous to delegate the
            processing of a Formal Objection, so it is sensible to establish a
            set of guidelines and best practices for that case.</p>
          <p>As a general rule, not all Formal Objections are equally far
            reaching. Simple Formal Objections might be raised on a matter of
            proposed new policy or on Charter proposals.  Other Objections might
            be strong and comprehensive disagreements with a consensus reached by a
            Working Group. It is not always easy to tell which Objections fall
            into which category - for example a simple Objection from EFF on the
            inclusion of content protection in the HTML Charter rightly took extensive
            discussion and analysis. This is a judgement call made by the
            Director.</p>

          <p>This document sets out best practices for delegates to use in
            addressing complex Formal Objections.  For simple objections it
            is not necessary to have an overly formal process.  This is
            irrespective of whether it involves a small fix or even if
            (after attempting to find consensus), the Director or delegate
            reach a conclusion overruling the objector.</p>

          <p>When a delegate makes a Director's decision in complex cases, to ensure
            fairness to all and the best solution for the Web, it is useful to be more
            formal and comprehensive.  Below are best practices to use in the
            case of a delegate handling such an Objection.</p>

          <h3>Delegate selection</h3>
          <p>In all cases, the Director will select a delegate who is
            neutral and fair to all sides in the dispute, and is also
            perceived as such.  This delegate must provide special effort to
            ensure they fully comprehend the point-of-view of those that
            they decide against.  Consequently, some of the language below
            emphasizes the sensitivity to the objector since in most cases
            the objector is fighting an uphill battle to get a majority
            point-of-view re-visited.</p>
          <h2 id="bp">Best Practices</h2>
          <p>The Best Practices are arranged in categories.</p>
          <h3>1. Thoroughness</h3>
          <p>This includes:</p>
          <dl>
            <dt>Understanding all sides of the argument.</dt>
            <dd>The delegate must be fully comfortable they understand all
              sides of the argument.  In particular, the delegate should not
              proceed with making decisions before hearing and understanding
              the objections (whether or not they agree with them).  This
              would include a decision tree which explains the key issues
              between the points of view.</dd>
            <dt>Consultation.</dt>
            <dd>The delegate should recognize that they have at their
              disposal any stakeholder who could reasonably inform the
              issue. This includes Working Groups, Chairs, Members, Team,
              and the general public.  On technical issues the TAG might be
              particularly useful.</dd>
            <dt>Best efforts to resolve via consensus.</dt>
            <dd>The delegate should search for potential consensus
              positions.  When that is not possible, at least the delegate
              is in a position to clearly articulate the rationale for the
              decision.</dd>
            <dt>Analysis of all arguments raised.</dt>
            <dd>Although the decision should be clear, well explained, and
              unambiguous, the decision should nonetheless acknowledge good
              points raised by the party that is not favored in the ruling,
              but explain why they are not decisive.</dd>
          </dl>
          <h3>2. Fairness</h3>
          <p>This includes:</p>
          <dl>
            <dt>Transparency.</dt>
            <dd>The delegate should inform all parties that the processing
              has been delegated to the delegate.  In this same spirit, when
              the Decision is released it should indicate to whom the
              Director delegated the objection.</dd>
            <dt>Adequate access.</dt>
            <dd>The delegate should offer all parties the opportunity to
              elaborate on their point of view.  For example, although the
              objection is already available in written form, the delegate
              should at least offer an opportunity to the objector to have a
              phone conversation.  All parties should be invited to key
              meetings where the delegate tries to assemble the various
              viewpoints.</dd>
            <dt>Primary authorship.</dt>
            <dd>The delegate should be the primary author of the Director's
              decision.</dd>
          </dl>
          <h3>3. Director review</h3>
          <p>For complex cases, the Director's decision should be reviewed
            by the Director before it goes out.  For simple cases, W3M
            (acting under Director's delegation) might conclude that is not
            necessary.</p>
          <h3>4. Communications</h3>
          <p>All parties should be generally apprised of the pace of the
            analysis, and through discussions be up to speed on the
            delegate's thinking.  As a result, when the Director's decision
            is issued, there would not be surprises for any of the parties.
            Communicating continuously does not impose any constraint on the
            delegate in making the decision, but it serves multiple useful
            purposes.  First, it allows the parties to gradually socialize
            in their organization what the decision is.  Second, if there is
            anything that the delegate misses in early analysis, it allows
            additional opportunities to hear about it.</p>
