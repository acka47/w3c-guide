## Sticky notes (to be removed)

**Status**: this document is for discussion purposes.  PLH, Judy, and Ralph were working outside of GitHub until Nov'21.

TODO: placeholder: Establish a repository to collect lessons learned during 2020 (TPAC breakouts, etc.)
<br>
TODO: (deferred) Figure out the structure to integrate in /Guide (given overlap with continuity page, workshops, etc.)
<br>
TODO: Consider whether W3C should create hardware kits to loan to a meeting host (Ralph)
<br>
TODO: Look at https://blog.zoom.us/zoom-rooms-reentering-the-office-hybrid-workforce/ for ideas (PLH)
  * virtual whiteboard?
<br>
TODO: Throughout the document, consider what advice we need to offer with regard to the human dimension, aka social considerations, training of meeting hosts, etc. (judy)
<br>
TODO: Add a section on "asking for help," complementary to up-front training, and written information resources (Judy)
<br>
TODO: Add a section on "dealing with opposition to hybrid" to directly address anticipated blocked (Judy)
<br>
TODO: Consider adding a "baseline principles" section (Ralph)
<br>
TODO: Consider how tooling may be able to support time-flexible hybrid, for instance by supporting granular agenda-presence preferences (PLH)
<br>
TODO: Examine [Remote Meetings](https://www.w3.org/wiki/Remote_Meetings) page (last updated in 2014) for further inspiration. (PLH - add to working references)
 * the meeting and queue management sections contain some good stuff
 * home settings: find a quiet room, hardware, etc.
<br>
TODO: Add advice to "be prepared for all eventualities," including checking regularly on changes in Covid situation, and communicating clearly with participants. Acknowledge that it takes extra time to prepare for all eventualities. (Judy)
<br>
TODO: (from W3M) Add checklists for meeting prep, potentially also for threshold considerations
<br>
TODO: (from W3M) Emphasize the need for microphone/speakerphone quality
<br>
TODO: (from W3M) Consider whether we can add recommendations for agility in decisions of hybrid vs virtual
<br>
TODO: Decide whether to leave this in its raw state, or do some clean-up and copy-editing so that it can at least be a useful reference. Types of copy-editing needed: tersifying to increase readability (reduce discussion and reflection, instead focus on practical bits, remove redundancies; make terminology and tone more consistent; update mentions of Covid status and precautions, and make it more time-agnostic; adjust flow; double-check absolute statements.
<br>
TODO: Make sure that the conferencing tools you use can be used on a standalone basis without interfering with other accounts or software that speakers or participants may need to rely on, including for accessibility support.
