## Sticky notes (to be removed)

**Status**: cleaning out the accumulated sticky notes, 20220810.  PLH, Judy, and Ralph.

TODO: placeholder: Establish a repository to collect lessons learned during 2020, 2021, 2022 (TPAC breakouts, etc.) -- probably Ralph.
<br>
TODO: Consider whether W3C should create hardware kits to loan to a meeting host (Ralph) Not for now, let's please park this suggestion in the "Lessons learned" repo - Judy, requesting of Ralph.
<br>
TODO: Look at https://blog.zoom.us/zoom-rooms-reentering-the-office-hybrid-workforce/ for ideas (PLH)
  * virtual whiteboard? LET'S CHAT ABOUT THIS ONE
<br>
TODO: Throughout the document, consider what advice we need to offer with regard to the human dimension, aka social considerations, training of meeting hosts, etc. (judy) -- UPDATED -- THINK THIS ONE IS DONE.
<br>
TODO: Add a section on "asking for help," complementary to up-front training, and written information resources (Judy) DITTO, DONE
<br>
TODO: Add a section on "dealing with opposition to hybrid" to directly address anticipated blocked (Judy) - REMOVE
<br>
TODO: Consider adding a "baseline principles" section (Ralph) -- SKIP THIS?
<br>
TODO: Consider how tooling may be able to support time-flexible hybrid, for instance by supporting granular agenda-presence preferences (PLH) BEEN THERE AND TRIED THAT! 
<br>
TODO: Examine [Remote Meetings](https://www.w3.org/wiki/Remote_Meetings) page (last updated in 2014) for further inspiration. (PLH - add to working references)
 * the meeting and queue management sections contain some good stuff
 * home settings: find a quiet room, hardware, etc.  THINK WE COVERED THIS, REMOVE?
<br>
TODO: Add advice to "be prepared for all eventualities," including checking regularly on changes in Covid situation, and communicating clearly with participants. Acknowledge that it takes extra time to prepare for all eventualities. (Judy) CHECK WHETHER WE COVERED THIS?
<br>
TODO: (from W3M) Add checklists for meeting prep, potentially also for threshold considerations CHECK WHETHER WE COVERED THIS?
<br>
TODO: (from W3M) Emphasize the need for microphone/speakerphone quality DONE, REMOVE
<br>
TODO: (from W3M) Consider whether we can add recommendations for agility in decisions of hybrid vs virtual MAY NEED A QUICK CHAT
<br>
TODO: Decide whether to leave this in its raw state, or do some clean-up and copy-editing so that it can at least be a useful reference. Types of copy-editing needed: tersifying to increase readability (reduce discussion and reflection, instead focus on practical bits, remove redundancies; make terminology and tone more consistent; update mentions of Covid status and precautions, and make it more time-agnostic; adjust flow; double-check absolute statements. -- REMOVE THIS META-COMMENT
<br>
TODO: Make sure that the conferencing tools you use can be used on a standalone basis without interfering with other accounts or software that speakers or participants may need to rely on, including for accessibility support. -- QUICK CHAT?
